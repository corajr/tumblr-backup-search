Okay apologies I\u2019ll go edit them</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here\u2019s the problem with this. AAVE is not this completely separate dialect and culture that does not overlap at all with Standard* American English and mainstream American culture. Words, phrases, and styles developed by black American speakers filter and diffuse into the mainstream dialect. If white people weren\u2019t allowed to use AAVE, we\u2019d also have to get rid of words like \u201ccool\u201d and \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d. Do some white people use AAVE to mock and insult black people? Of course, and they\u2019re racist scumfucks and need to be called out when they do it. But to genuinely adopt phrases used by black speakers because you find them useful and enjoyable in your speaking, is not racist or \u201cappropriation.\u201d And furthermore, for the vast majority of words and phrases, this happened naturally, without anyone consciously thinking to themselves \u201cthis is AAVE\u201d. They just learned a new word or phrase, found it useful or cool, and started using it. When \u201chella\u201d spread around the American dialect, very few people consciously thought \u201cBay Area young people invented this\u201d, They just heard it and started using it, <em>because that\u2019s how language evolves</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alright here\u2019s the deal. Using bits and pieces of AAVE isn\u2019t cultural appropriation. It just isn\u2019t. First of all, AAVE speakers regularly come into contact with non-AAVE speakers and AAVE leaks its way into mainstream English use. To imply that they don\u2019t is ridiculous. That\u2019s the first problem here.</p>\n<p>The second problem here is that \u201cappropriation\u201d is used entirely wrongly and entirely too often on this site. Cultural appropriation should only be used to refer to when one group (usually white people) CLAIMS the creation of another group as its own. That\u2019s it. If it doesn\u2019t fit that definition, it isn\u2019t appropriation. And here\u2019s why!</p>\n<p>The third problem, and the reason people need to stop fucking using \u201cappropriation\u201d as a term so loosely on this site is because it allows us to ignore instances of racism by calling them something else- a more technical, academic seeming term. So</p>\n<ul><li>If you use another culture\u2019s speaking pattern as a joke, that isn\u2019t cultural appropriation. That\u2019s being a racist. You\u2019re literally making a joke about how other people talk. That\u2019s racism. Not appropriation. RACISM. We have a word for that already.</li>\n<li>If you use another culture\u2019s sacred symbology or something like that, it isn\u2019t appropriation. It\u2019s being clueless at best and thoughtless/insensitive at worst. It isn\u2019t appropriation. The basic problem there is not theft of another culture\u2019s items: the basic problem is not participating in a culture on that culture\u2019s terms.</li>\n<li>If you use another culture as a prop or a joke, that isn\u2019t appropriation. It\u2019s racism. You\u2019re pointing at a group and laughing. That\u2019s just racism. Let\u2019s not call it something else. Miley Cyrus isn\u2019t appropriating black culture. She\u2019s making fun of it. That\u2019s racism. Easy.</li>\n<li>If you use another culture\u2019s symbology inaccurately, again that isn\u2019t appropriation. It\u2019s being thoughtless and inconsiderate but it isn\u2019t appropriation.</li>\n<li>If it isn\u2019t one group claiming it created something it isn\u2019t, then it isn\u2019t appropriation.</li>\n</ul><p>There are several problems with insisting that white people participating in AAVE even in small portions is appropriation. 1- it lets white people off the hook for instances of actual racism by calling it something else, something which seems less intentional than it really is. 2- it assumes that white people already have a frame of reference for everything and should never have to refer to other cultures for ideas/concepts. That second idea is fucked up because:</p>\n<ol><li>It assumes that white/mainstream/Western culture understands everything already. That\u2019s literally just colonialism wrapped up in a nice liberal package people can use to pat themselves on the back.</li>\n<li>It ignores the fact that white culture (using that loosely, but I\u2019m sure most people understand what I mean by this) actually doesn\u2019t have a way to express everything. For example, \u201c\u2014\u2014 game strong\u201d says more than just \u201cyou \u2014\u2014 look[s] good.\u201d There is no approximation in standard English. Standard English is not a perfect, all-encompassing language.</li>\n</ol><p>TLDR: use of AAVE in bits and pieces is not appropriation, and outside of tumblr I know very few black people who actually consider it to be appropriation. If you use it poorly, you\u2019re just misinformed and will probably be laughed at. If you mock it, you\u2019re just a racist. Stop calling every single instance of two cultures interacting \u201cappropriation\u201d because it allows us to ignore the fact that many times when people on here use it, we are referring to instances of racism and letting the racism itself go unaddressed by not calling it what it is. I only know a few black people ON tumblr who consider use of AAVE phrases to be appropriative or racist, and quite frankly I think that view 1- is simplistic and makes no sense and 2- would be laughed off by most black people who hadn\u2019t been steeped in that narrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Appropriation is literally the act of taking something for one&rsquo;s own \u2014 the taker might later claim it was always theirs, but that&rsquo;s not a necessary condition for appropriation. All of the examples above are both appropriative and racist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That said, appropriation isn&rsquo;t a cardinal sin! I don\u2019t have a problem with every instance of white people using AAVE. Still, there\u2019s often something troubling about it which needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I\u2019d draw an analogy to Jane Hill\u2019s <a href=\"http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/\">work on Mock Spanish</a>. She argues that for white people, peppering their speech with things like \u201cno problemo\u201d or \u201cma\u00f1ana\u201d serves two functions: 1) explicitly, to signal that the speaker is easy-going and culturally fluent, and 2) implicitly, to invoke racist stereotypes of Spanish speakers, as if to say \u201cAren\u2019t <em>those people</em> such a joke! Glad <em>we\u2019re</em> not like that.\u201d (She calls these \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d indexicality.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hill notes that people will \u201coften claim that Mock Spanish shows that they appreciate Spanish language and culture.\u201d In the same way, I think some white folks using AAVE, calling themselves \u201cbois,\u201d etc., would say they are appreciating black culture, not appropriating it \u2014 if they even realize these things have black origins, given how quickly the white mainstream has assimilated them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This cognitive dissonance is possible precisely because there seems to be a wide gulf between such phenomena and \u201cactual racism.\u201d However, they\u2019re both part of the same ideological framework, which holds that black culture and black life have no value save for decorating white bodies and serving white interests.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Put another way: in the mainstream context, black speech from a white person is heard as expressive, witty, or at worst, mildly embarrassing. Black speech from a black person is heard at best as unintentionally hilarious (Sweet Brown, Antoine Dodson, the singer of \u201cIt\u2019s So Cold in the D\u201d) or as cause for unabashed contempt (Rachel Jeantel).

White people using AAVE is often a continuation of that dynamic, even if such borrowing is inevitable due to the porous boundaries of culture.
