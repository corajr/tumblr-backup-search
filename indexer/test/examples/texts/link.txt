They have also disabled every effort I have made to make a new account.</p>
<p>This is silencing. I am not the only trans person this has happened to. Facebook is targeting&mdash;either directly or indirectly, through the easily abused &ldquo;report&rdquo; functionality&mdash;at-risk users, including trans people, sex workers, survivors, and activists/advocates. Evidently, Facebook doesn&rsquo;t think these identities are &ldquo;authentic.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we not all entitled to the same rights to privacy and identity? If Facebook wants to brand itself as a &ldquo;positive force,&rdquo; should it not emphasize the protection of at-risk users? This cannot be tolerated.&nbsp;</p> angelboyangelboy <p>I don&rsquo;t know if everyone has heard about this, but D. Dragonetti, a non-binary trans person who has been facing a lot of online harassment after outing people in the Alt-Lit community as abusers, has had his facebook account repeatedly shut down after being reported to facebook staff as using a false name.</p>
<p>Just in case anyone thought that facebook&rsquo;s photo-ops with drag queens signaled a real commitment to ending their policy of enabling harassment of trans persons using their community reporting system and wasn&rsquo;t just a PR stunt orchestrated to get trans people to shut up</p> jobhaver      http://jobhaver.tumblr.com/post/100516867510/angelboyangelboy-facebook-deleted-my-primary
