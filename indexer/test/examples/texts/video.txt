<p>&ldquo;Cheryl is young, Black, and lesbian, working in Philadelphia with her best friend Tamara and consumed by a film project: to make a video about her search for a Black actress from Philly who appeared in films in the 30s and was known as the Watermelon Woman. Following various leads, Cheryl discovers the Watermelon Woman&rsquo;s stage name and real name and surmises that the actress had a long affair with Martha Page, a White woman and one of Hollywood&rsquo;s few female directors.

More discoveries bring Cheryl (and us, her audience) to new realizations.&rdquo;</p>
