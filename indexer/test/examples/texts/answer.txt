I think "____ game strong" is AAVE, so don't appropriate it <p>Oh it is? Okay apologies I&rsquo;ll go edit them</p> girllenin <p>Here&rsquo;s the problem with this. AAVE is not this completely separate dialect and culture that does not overlap at all with Standard* American English and mainstream American culture. Words, phrases, and styles developed by black American speakers filter and diffuse into the mainstream dialect. If white people weren&rsquo;t allowed to use AAVE, we&rsquo;d also have to get rid of words like &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and &ldquo;rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll&rdquo;. Do some white people use AAVE to mock and insult black people? Of course, and they&rsquo;re racist scumfucks and need to be called out when they do it. But to genuinely adopt phrases used by black speakers because you find them useful and enjoyable in your speaking, is not racist or &ldquo;appropriation.&rdquo; And furthermore, for the vast majority of words and phrases, this happened naturally, without anyone consciously thinking to themselves &ldquo;this is AAVE&rdquo;. They just learned a new word or phrase, found it useful or cool, and started using it. When &ldquo;hella&rdquo; spread around the American dialect, very few people consciously thought &ldquo;Bay Area young people invented this&rdquo;, They just heard it and started using it, <em>because that&rsquo;s how language evolves</em>.</p> anarchists-for-big-government <p>Alright here&rsquo;s the deal. Using bits and pieces of AAVE isn&rsquo;t cultural appropriation. It just isn&rsquo;t. First of all, AAVE speakers regularly come into contact with non-AAVE speakers and AAVE leaks its way into mainstream English use. To imply that they don&rsquo;t is ridiculous. That&rsquo;s the first problem here.</p>
<p>The second problem here is that &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; is used entirely wrongly and entirely too often on this site. Cultural appropriation should only be used to refer to when one group (usually white people) CLAIMS the creation of another group as its own. That&rsquo;s it. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit that definition, it isn&rsquo;t appropriation. And here&rsquo;s why!</p>
<p>The third problem, and the reason people need to stop fucking using &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; as a term so loosely on this site is because it allows us to ignore instances of racism by calling them something else- a more technical, academic seeming term. So</p>
<ul><li>If you use another culture&rsquo;s speaking pattern as a joke, that isn&rsquo;t cultural appropriation. That&rsquo;s being a racist. You&rsquo;re literally making a joke about how other people talk. That&rsquo;s racism. Not appropriation. RACISM. We have a word for that already.</li>
<li>If you use another culture&rsquo;s sacred symbology or something like that, it isn&rsquo;t appropriation. It&rsquo;s being clueless at best and thoughtless/insensitive at worst. It isn&rsquo;t appropriation. The basic problem there is not theft of another culture&rsquo;s items: the basic problem is not participating in a culture on that culture&rsquo;s terms.</li>
<li>If you use another culture as a prop or a joke, that isn&rsquo;t appropriation. It&rsquo;s racism. You&rsquo;re pointing at a group and laughing. That&rsquo;s just racism. Let&rsquo;s not call it something else. Miley Cyrus isn&rsquo;t appropriating black culture. She&rsquo;s making fun of it. That&rsquo;s racism. Easy.</li>
<li>If you use another culture&rsquo;s symbology inaccurately, again that isn&rsquo;t appropriation. It&rsquo;s being thoughtless and inconsiderate but it isn&rsquo;t appropriation.</li>
<li>If it isn&rsquo;t one group claiming it created something it isn&rsquo;t, then it isn&rsquo;t appropriation.</li>
</ul><p>There are several problems with insisting that white people participating in AAVE even in small portions is appropriation. 1- it lets white people off the hook for instances of actual racism by calling it something else, something which seems less intentional than it really is. 2- it assumes that white people already have a frame of reference for everything and should never have to refer to other cultures for ideas/concepts. That second idea is fucked up because:</p>
<ol><li>It assumes that white/mainstream/Western culture understands everything already. That&rsquo;s literally just colonialism wrapped up in a nice liberal package people can use to pat themselves on the back.</li>
<li>It ignores the fact that white culture (using that loosely, but I&rsquo;m sure most people understand what I mean by this) actually doesn&rsquo;t have a way to express everything. For example, &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; game strong&rdquo; says more than just &ldquo;you &mdash;&mdash; look[s] good.&rdquo; There is no approximation in standard English. Standard English is not a perfect, all-encompassing language.</li>
</ol><p>TLDR: use of AAVE in bits and pieces is not appropriation, and outside of tumblr I know very few black people who actually consider it to be appropriation. If you use it poorly, you&rsquo;re just misinformed and will probably be laughed at. If you mock it, you&rsquo;re just a racist. Stop calling every single instance of two cultures interacting &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; because it allows us to ignore the fact that many times when people on here use it, we are referring to instances of racism and letting the racism itself go unaddressed by not calling it what it is. I only know a few black people ON tumblr who consider use of AAVE phrases to be appropriative or racist, and quite frankly I think that view 1- is simplistic and makes no sense and 2- would be laughed off by most black people who hadn&rsquo;t been steeped in that narrative.</p> queercommunist <p>Appropriation is literally the act of taking something for one&rsquo;s own &mdash; the taker might later claim it was always theirs, but that&rsquo;s not a necessary condition for appropriation.

<p>That said, appropriation isn&rsquo;t a cardinal sin! I don&rsquo;t have a problem with every instance of white people using AAVE. Still, there&rsquo;s often something troubling about it which needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d draw an analogy to Jane Hill&rsquo;s <a href="http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/">work on Mock Spanish</a>. She argues that for white people, peppering their speech with things like &ldquo;no problemo&rdquo; or &ldquo;ma&ntilde;ana&rdquo; serves two functions: 1) explicitly, to signal that the speaker is easy-going and culturally fluent, and 2) implicitly, to invoke racist stereotypes of Spanish speakers, as if to say &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t <em>those people</em> such a joke! Glad <em>we&rsquo;re</em> not like that.&rdquo; (She calls these &ldquo;direct&rdquo; and &ldquo;indirect&rdquo; indexicality.)</p>
<p>Hill notes that people will &ldquo;often claim that Mock Spanish shows that they appreciate Spanish language and culture.&rdquo; In the same way, I think some white folks using AAVE, calling themselves &ldquo;bois,&rdquo; etc., would say they are appreciating black culture, not appropriating it &mdash; if they even realize these things have black origins, given how quickly the white mainstream has assimilated them.</p>
<p>This cognitive dissonance is possible precisely because there seems to be a wide gulf between such phenomena and &ldquo;actual racism.&rdquo; However, they&rsquo;re both part of the same ideological framework, which holds that black culture and black life have no value save for decorating white bodies and serving white interests.</p>

<p>Put another way: in the mainstream context, black speech from a white person is heard as expressive, witty, or at worst, mildly embarrassing. Black speech from a black person is heard at best as unintentionally hilarious (Sweet Brown, Antoine Dodson, the singer of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s So Cold in the D&rdquo;) or as cause for unabashed contempt (Rachel Jeantel). These attitudes have huge material consequences in job interviews, schools, the court system&hellip; pretty much every institution and part of life.</p>
<p>Further, the idea that the dominant culture is &ldquo;boring&rdquo; and needs to be &ldquo;spiced up&rdquo; by incorporation of &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; elements is a classic colonialist anxiety. White people using AAVE is often a continuation of that dynamic, even if such borrowing is inevitable due to the porous boundaries of culture. It can&rsquo;t be helped, but indulging that kind of white entitlement leads to tiresome shit like &ldquo;Thug Kitchen,&rdquo; and nobody wants that.</p>
<p>Despite its overuse, I believe &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; is still needed to describe this particular aspect of how racism operates.&nbsp;If you are white and sprinkle your speech with AAVE, you don&rsquo;t have to stop necessarily &mdash; but I&rsquo;d ask that you think very carefully about whose words you&rsquo;re using and why.</p> polychora I think "____ game strong" is AAVE, so don't appropriate it <p><a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://queercommunist.tumblr.com/post/98932642271/i-think-game-strong-is-aave-so-dont">queercommunist</a>:</p>
